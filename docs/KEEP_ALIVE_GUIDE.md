# Render Keep-Alive Solutions Guide

This document explains how to prevent Render's free tier from spinning down your application due to inactivity, which would stop scheduled jobs.

## üö® **The Problem**

Render's free tier spins down applications after **15 minutes of inactivity**. This causes:
- ‚ùå **Scheduled jobs stop running**
- ‚ùå **All timers and background tasks halt**
- ‚ùå **Application restarts "cold" on next request**
- ‚ùå **Loss of in-memory scheduler state**

## ‚úÖ **Our Multi-Layered Solution**

### 1. **Internal Keep-Alive Service** (Automatic)

**What it does:**
- Self-pings the application every 10 minutes
- Monitors scheduler health and restarts if needed
- Only runs in production environment
- Provides status monitoring

**Endpoints Added:**
- `/health` - Health check with system status
- `/keep-alive` - Simple ping endpoint
- `/debug/keep-alive` - Service status and monitoring

**How it works:**
```python
# Automatically enabled in production
# Self-ping every 10 minutes
# Health monitoring every 5 minutes
# Scheduler restart protection
```

### 2. **External Monitoring Services** (Recommended)

For maximum reliability, set up external services to ping your app:

#### **UptimeRobot** (Recommended - Free & Reliable)
```
Free Plan: 50 monitors, 5-minute intervals
Setup URL: https://uptimerobot.com/

Steps:
1. Create free account
2. Add Monitor ‚Üí HTTP(s)
3. URL: https://your-app.onrender.com/health
4. Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes
5. Enable email notifications
```

#### **Pingdom** (Alternative)
```
Free Plan: Basic monitoring
Setup URL: https://www.pingdom.com/

Steps:
1. Sign up for free account
2. Create uptime check
3. URL: https://your-app.onrender.com/health
4. Check interval: 5 minutes
```

#### **StatusCake** (Most Generous Free Tier)
```
Free Plan: Unlimited tests
Setup URL: https://www.statuscake.com/

Steps:
1. Create account
2. Add uptime test
3. URL: https://your-app.onrender.com/keep-alive
4. Frequency: Every 5 minutes
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Setup Instructions**

### Step 1: Deploy with Keep-Alive Service

Your application already includes the keep-alive service. When deploying to Render:

1. **Set Environment Variable:**
   ```
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```

2. **The service will automatically:**
   - Start internal self-ping scheduler
   - Monitor application health
   - Provide status endpoints

### Step 2: Set Up External Monitoring

**Choose one or more external services:**

1. **UptimeRobot Setup (Recommended):**
   ```
   Monitor Type: HTTP(s)
   URL: https://your-app.onrender.com/health
   Interval: 5 minutes
   Keyword Monitoring: "healthy" (optional)
   ```

2. **Configure Alerts:**
   - Email notifications for downtime
   - Webhook alerts (optional)
   - SMS alerts (paid plans)

### Step 3: Verify Setup

1. **Check Internal Service:**
   - Visit `/debug/keep-alive` in your app
   - Verify service is running and pinging

2. **Monitor External Service:**
   - Check your monitoring dashboard
   - Verify successful pings every 5 minutes

3. **Test Effectiveness:**
   - Leave app idle for 20+ minutes
   - Verify app stays responsive
   - Check scheduler continues running

## üìä **Monitoring & Troubleshooting**

### Debug Endpoints:

- **`/debug`** - Main debug dashboard with keep-alive status
- **`/debug/keep-alive`** - Detailed keep-alive service information
- **`/health`** - JSON health check for external monitoring
- **`/keep-alive`** - Simple ping endpoint

### Status Indicators:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "app_url": "https://your-app.onrender.com",
  "ping_interval_minutes": 10,
  "last_ping": "2025-08-12T10:30:00",
  "failed_pings": 0,
  "scheduler_running": true
}
```

### Common Issues:

**Internal Service Not Working:**
- Check `ENVIRONMENT=production` is set
- Verify no firewall blocking self-requests
- Check application logs for errors

**External Monitoring Failing:**
- Verify monitor URL is correct
- Check if Render app is responding
- Review monitoring service settings

**Scheduler Still Stopping:**
- Check both internal and external monitoring
- Verify ping frequency (should be < 15 minutes)
- Review Render application logs

## üéØ **Best Practices**

### Monitoring Setup:
1. **Use Multiple Services:** UptimeRobot + StatusCake for redundancy
2. **Short Intervals:** 5-minute pings (well under 15-minute limit)
3. **Multiple Endpoints:** Monitor both `/health` and `/keep-alive`
4. **Alert Configuration:** Set up notifications for quick response

### Application Design:
1. **Graceful Degradation:** App works even if keep-alive fails
2. **Health Checks:** Comprehensive status reporting
3. **Scheduler Recovery:** Automatic restart on failure
4. **Logging:** Track ping success/failure for debugging

### Security Considerations:
1. **Rate Limiting:** Built-in protection against abuse
2. **User-Agent Tracking:** Identify legitimate monitoring
3. **Error Handling:** Graceful failure without exposing internals

## üìà **Expected Results**

With proper setup, you should see:

‚úÖ **Continuous Operation:**
- Application stays responsive 24/7
- Scheduled jobs run on time
- No cold starts or restarts

‚úÖ **Reliable Monitoring:**
- Real-time status visibility
- Immediate alerts on issues
- Historical uptime tracking

‚úÖ **Resource Efficiency:**
- Minimal overhead from keep-alive
- Smart scheduling prevents abuse
- Automatic cleanup and recovery

## üÜò **Emergency Recovery**

If the app does spin down despite monitoring:

1. **Manual Wake-Up:** Visit any page to restart
2. **Check Monitoring:** Verify external services are active
3. **Review Logs:** Check for service failures or errors
4. **Restart Scheduler:** Use `/debug/scheduler` if needed

## üîÆ **Future Improvements**

Potential enhancements for even better reliability:

- **Smart Interval Adjustment:** Dynamic ping frequency based on usage
- **Multiple Render Regions:** Geo-distributed monitoring
- **Database-Backed Recovery:** Persistent job state across restarts
- **Integration with CI/CD:** Automated monitoring setup
